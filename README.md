# Learning Unreal

This repository contains my journey through various tutorials learning Unreal. 

## How I use this repository
- Each tutorial project is based on some tutorial content from the internet. I then expand on the tutorial by a small amount to exercise my understanding. 

- If I am learning a lot of new things and doing them while constantly referencing the tutorial, I like to try and practice it one more time, by branching off the initial commit and trying to accomplish everything I learned without referencing the source.

- After I have wrapped up a project, I add my learnings, questions, answers, expansions, and inferences in the project's readme.

## My background
I come from a programming background, with Unity experience starting around 2011. Initially, my experience was working on hobby games with early Unity versions. I never gained much 3D modeling, animation or texturing experience, I mostly worked with static meshes. I have some, but limited experience with shader programming or shader-graph-like tools.

I have however been professionally using the Unity engine and programming in C# for it extensively since 2012, building a mobile non-game application. A typical AAA-style game programmer would primarily focus on animation logic, multiplayer, or AI behaviours. My experience was mostly gained on platform engineering, general software architecture and UI manipulation.
